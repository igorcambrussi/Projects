# Projects
In this repository I'll keep some of the codes in C that I have developed in my Computational Physics classes: a 1-year course that I did in 2018 at the 
Federal University of Santa Catarina, where I'm majoring in Physics - currently I'm a senior student.
Among the codes, there will be:
-Physics Simulations of Simple Mechanical Systems (mass-spring systems, pendulum, ...)
-Physics Simulations of Chaotic Mechanical Systems (damped and driven pendulum, non-linear oscillators, 3-body problem, Ed. Lorenz' Model of Convection)
